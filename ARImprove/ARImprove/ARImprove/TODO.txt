Information about the new solution created with the AddOnInstallerWizard
****************************************************************

The project with the same name as you gave for the solution is the project 
who will generate your addon installer executable.

The CustomerLibrary project contains an extension of the Windows Installer project.

The Setup project is an empty Windows Installer project. This setup project
is automaticaly included into the Installer project.

The only project to modify is the Setup project. 
The other two projects only need to be recompiled at the end.


****************************************************************
Actions to be completed to create your Installer.exe
****************************************************************

Please follow this steps to complete the Setup project:

1. Add the .exe file of your addon application and all the files you need to run
your addon to the FileSystem view.
(Right click under Setup project, then View -> FileSystem.
Add each one of the files and directories you need in the corresponding folder.
Application folder contains the image that will be copied to the installation 
directory)

The Interop.SAPbouiCOM.DLL or/and Interop.SAPbobsCOM.DLL will be automaticaly 
added to the Detected Dependencies of your Setup project.

2. Add the CustomerLibrary as project output.
(Right click under Setup project, then Add -> Project Output and choose 
CustomerLibrary).

3. Right click on the SAPbouiCOM.exe and SAPbobsCOM.dll dependencies and
choose Exclude for both of them.
(a symbol will appear on the left-down corner of each dependency icon).

4. Right click on the dotnetfxredist_x86.msm dependency and click Exclude if 
it is not already excluded (a symbol will appear on the left-down corner of 
the dependency icon).

5. Add CustomerLibrary output as Custom Action for all possible custom actions.
Right click on Setup project then View-> Custom Actions to have access to the 
custom actions, you will have then all actions custom can modify 
(Install, Commit, Rollback, Uninstal). Add the CustomerLibrary output (look for it
inside the Application folder) for all the custom actions.

6. Add a needed parameter into Commit custom action library properties. 
For that set the CustomActionData property of the Commit action (right click on
Commit Primary output from CustomerLibrary and then choose Properties Window) to 
/target="[TARGETDIR]\"

7. Change ProductName, ProductCode, Manufacturer, Author and Title at least into 
the Setup properties in order to avoid colisions with other AddOns installers 
created with this wizard.

8. Change Project Dependencies into the Solution properties to build the projects 
in the order:
  1. CustomerLibrary
  2. Setup
  3. Your project name
  
8. Rebuild the entire solution.

****************************************************************
Actions to be done before installing the addon  
****************************************************************

Now that you have the Installer.exe file you need to create a .ard file
needed by Business One to complete the installation.

To create the .ard file you can use the AddOnRegDataGen.bat file located in the 
directory named AddOnRegDataGenFile inside the main project generated.

You need to launch the AddOnRegDataGen.bat execution every time you recompile 
your AddOn.exe or the Installer.exe projects.

You can find more information about the general installation procedure into the 
UI API Help document, chapter "Package and Installation".
